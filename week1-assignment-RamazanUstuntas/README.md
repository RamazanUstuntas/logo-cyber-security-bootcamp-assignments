# week1-assignment

- XMLHttpRequest araştırılacak ve jsonplaceholder kullanılarak içerisindeki userlar console’a yazdırılacak.

# What is XMLHttpRequest?
<p>XMLHttpRequest (XHR) objects are used to interact with servers. 
You can retrieve data from a URL without having to do a full page refresh. 
This enables a Web page to update just part of a page without disrupting what the user is doing.</p>

<p>In this project, we will send a request to a remote server with xmlhttprequest and print its response on the console screen.
To send an HTTP request, create an XMLHttpRequest object, open a URL, and send the request.
After the transaction completes,the object will contain useful information such as the response body and the HTTP status of the result.</p>

## Prerequisites
the required module : npm i xmlhttprequest
